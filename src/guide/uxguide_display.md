## Displaying Payments
### UX Principles
- History should be **clear, transparent, and verifiable**.
- Offer both **simple summaries** and **deeper technical details**.

### Guidelines
1. **Display fees separately** from the amount.
2. **Prefer the Lightning address** over the invoice description in titles for readability.
3. **Show associated metadata** â€” at minimum the **invoice** and **preimage**.  
   Keep under an expandable **Details** section to avoid clutter by default.
4. **Represent states:** **Pending**, **Succeeded**, **Failed** (with distinct visuals).
