## Seed & Key Management

### UX Principles
- Onboarding should be **seamless**; don’t block first use with seed backup.
- Encourage security without forcing it prematurely.

### Guidelines
1. **Allow seed backup after wallet creation** or **after the first received payment** to keep onboarding smooth.
2. **Explain** the need to **write down and save** the seed phrase.
3. **Consider validation** (e.g., partial re-entry) to confirm backup.
4. **Enhance key-management UX where possible:** encrypted cloud backup, or **Web 2 / identity–based** approaches that preserve self-custody.
